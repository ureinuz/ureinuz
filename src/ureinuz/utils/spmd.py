"""Utilities for working with jit and partitioned models.

This module introduces ``axis_rules``, ``logical_to_mesh_axes``,
``logical_to_mesh``, ``with_logical_constraint`` for appyling jit sharding
constraints in terms of "logical named axes" rather than jit's default mesh
axes.

Additionally the ``LogicallyPartitioned`` metadata wrapper is defined as
well as the initializer function wrapper ``with_logical_partitioning``for
introducing logical axis metadata into a model's variables.

  The rules are in order of precedence, and consist of pairs:
  ``(ArrayDimensionName, MeshDimensionName)``, meaning that the given array
  dimension (if present and unused) should be sharded across the given
  mesh dimension (if present and unused).

  A Layout of an Array is expressed as a tuple with one element for each
  dimension in the Array. The element is either None, or is the name of a
  mesh-dimension, meaning that this dimension of the array is sharded across
  this dimension of the mesh.

  For example, given an array with::

    array_dim_names = ('batch', 'length', 'heads', 'features')

  and the layout rules are::

    rules = (('batch', 'X'),
             ('features', 'X'),
             ('heads', 'Y'),
             ('batch', 'Z'))

    array_dim_names: Tuple of array dimension names or None.
    rules: Optional logical to mesh rules override.  Defaults to using the
      rules defined in the dynamic context set from the ``axis_rules`` function.

  Returns:
    PartitionSpec for the parameter.
